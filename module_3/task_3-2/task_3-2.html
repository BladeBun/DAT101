      <li>[In part 1, is it possible to solve the problem using a single "for" loop?]</li>
      <p>[Its technically possible but its more complicated than just using 2 for loops, in this case in part1.]</p>
      <li>[In part 2, can we create what is known as an "infinite" loop within the condition of the "while" loop?
        Describe what would or would not be necessary to achieve this. Provide a thorough explanation of
        your answer.]</li>
      <p>[To achieve in creating a infinite loop, the condition in while must always be true. In this case, the random number that is generated will always be within the limits to prevent such infinite loop. So if we were to for example make a mistake in the logic, it may cause an infinite loop.]</p>
      <li>[Discuss briefly how quickly or slowly a computer might be able to compute this, considering the
        number of guesses and the time it takes. How does the program behave while it is guessing? Can
        the program perform other tasks concurrently?]</li>
      <p>[The way the computer guesses the number is that it loops til it finds the number that its guessing and the looping process itself goes extremely fast. It depends on the situation but, for it to perform other tasks concurrently while guessing, it must be ran in async.]</p>
      <li>[Explain the relationship between rows and columns in nested "for" loops. Can we, for instance,
        change the order, considering rows to be innermost or columns to be innermost, or does this not
        matter?]</li>
      <p>[When we have a for loop inside another for loop, a so called nested loop, the inner loop will run through each element of the outer loop. For example: The inner loop will run 10 times for each amount of the outer loop. If the outer loop has 10 iterations, the inner loop will run 100 times.]</p>

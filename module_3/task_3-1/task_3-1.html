      <li>Discuss the behavior of part 1, What happens when the wake-up time is not 7 and what happens when it is exactly 7?</li>
      <p>[When its more than 7, nothing gets printed, the times has to be 7 or less so that he will make it to school]</p>
      <li>Same as question #1. How ever the answer should now be different. Discuss the behaviour of part 2, What happens when the wake-up time is not 7 and what happens when it is exactly 7?</li>
      <p>[When the wakeup time is more than 7 then he has to take the car to school, while if it is less than 7 or exactly 7 then he has to take the bus.]</p>
      <li>Discuss the behavior of part 3, what happens when wake time is less than 7 or greater than 8?</li>
      <p>[When its less than 7 or greater than 8 then he has to take the car, but additionally if he woke up only less than 7 he can wait to take the bus.]</p>
      <li>Discuss the behavior for part 4, what happens if the number is exactly 0, is zero positive or negative?</li>
      <p>[We have to both check negative and positive math.signs to eliminate the possibility of 0 being a positive or negative number which it is not, but if we were to go off with what we currently were doing in part4 then we would get that 0 is Negative.]</p>
